# M-E-N Base: A quick start base for MongoDB-Express-Node stack

M-E-N Base is a simple and flexible quick start base to create fullstack webapps using Node, Express and MongoDB with MVC architecture.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To run M-E-N Base, you need a recent version of Node, Express and MongoDB installed (obviously). If it's not the case, here are some useful links:

* [node](https://nodejs.org)
* [express](http://expressjs.com)
* [mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation)

### Before running the project

To run the project, be sure to have a mongoDB instance running. If it's not the case, run: 
```
$ mongod
```
For more information about the mongo shell, please refer to [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/).

Then, edit package.json file by remplacing some fields values like "name", "description" and "version".

In helpers/db.js, replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017/men-base' by your own database uri.

### Run the project

To run the project simply type:
```
$ npm start
```

Great, you're done. Go to "localhost:3000", a start page using a M-E-N stack with MVC architecture is waiting for you.

## Sample files

Some sample files are coming with men base: 
* index.js -> controller
* sampleMongoMode -> model
* index.ejs -> view

 Don't hesitate to copy them and reuse their structure.

## Modules informations

Men base natively comes with ejs template system, fell free to change it if you prefer some other module like Jade.

Men base also use Mongoose. You can replace it with another ORM/ODM or directly with mongo driver but keep in mind that you'll have to create a new db helper.
